                <p> <strong>LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></p>
                <p>South Edmonton Youth acknowledges that Edmonton is located within Treaty 6 Territory and within the Métis homelands and Métis Nation of Alberta Region 4. We acknowledge this land as the traditional territories of many First Nations such as the Nehiyaw (Cree), Denesuliné (Dene), Nakota Sioux (Stoney), Anishinaabe (Saulteaux) and Niitsitapi (Blackfoot).</p>

                <p><strong>LEGAL</strong></p>
                <p>Have we been incorporated yet? No, but we're working on that. In my opinion, we should hire a lawyer, but everyone keeps telling me we're too poor for that. That's first world problems tbh. Okay honestly I don't know what else to put here also I copied and pasted that land acknolwedgement from the City of Edmonton website. </p>

                <p><strong>CONTACT US</strong></p>
                <p>There are many ways to reach out to us. Carrier pigeon is an interesting one, although it might not work very well if you're outside of Edmonton or Alberta. We also take cryptic notes written in blood on the walls. Another great way is by playing a really long game of telephone with that random person in the beanie walking by on the street. Yeah, him.</p>
